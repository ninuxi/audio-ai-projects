### Adding New Cultural Institution Integrations

We especially welcome contributions that add support for new cultural institutions:

1. **Research the Institution**
   - Understand their audio archives
   - Identify specific needs and workflows
   - Document API/integration requirements

2. **Create Integration Module**
   ```python
   # week4-cultural-ai/integrations/institution_name.py
   class InstitutionNameIntegration:
       """Integration for [Institution Name]"""
       
       def __init__(self, config):
           self.config = config
           
       def process_archive(self, audio_files):
           """Process institution-specific archive format"""
           pass
   ```

3. **Add Documentation**
   - Create `docs/integrations/institution_name.md`
   - Include setup instructions
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document any special requirements

### Improving AI Models

1. **Dataset Contributions**
   - Add labeled cultural audio samples
   - Improve existing classifications
   - Expand regional/dialect coverage

2. **Model Improvements**
   - Optimize existing algorithms
   - Add new classification categories
   - Improve accuracy metrics

3. **Testing & Validation**

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

```python
# Good example
class AudioProcessor:
    """
    Process audio files for cultural heritage applications.
    
    This class handles various audio processing tasks specific to
    cultural institution needs.
    
    Attributes:
        sample_rate (int): Audio sample rate in Hz
        channels (int): Number of audio channels
    """
    
    def __init__(self, sample_rate: int = 44100, channels: int = 2):
        self.sample_rate = sample_rate
        self.channels = channels
        
    def process_heritage_audio(self, audio_path: str) -> dict:
        """
        Process heritage audio file and extract metadata.
        
        Args:
            audio_path: Path to audio file
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary containing audio metadata and analysis results
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If audio file is invalid
        """
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### Documentation Style

- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type hints for all functions
- Provide examples in docstrings for complex functions
- Keep README files updated and comprehensive

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
feat: add RAI Teche integration module
fix: correct audio normalization in batch processor
docs: update installation instructions for Windows
test: add unit tests for heritage classifier
refactor: optimize FFT computation for large files
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
```python
# tests/test_audio_processor.py
import pytest
from week1_audio_visualizer import AudioProcessor

class TestAudioProcessor:
    def test_sample_rate_validation(self):
        """Test that invalid sample rates raise ValueError"""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            AudioProcessor(sample_rate=-1)
            
    def test_process_heritage_audio(self, sample_audio_file):
        """Test heritage audio processing"""
        processor = AudioProcessor()
        result = processor.process_heritage_audio(sample_audio_file)
        assert 'metadata' in result
        assert result['metadata']['duration'] > 0
```
